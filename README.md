# ft_printf
ft_printf is a recreation of the standard C library's printf function. This project is part of the curriculum at 42 School and is designed to provide a deeper understanding of variadic functions and the implementation of the printf function.

## Features
The ft_printf function supports the following flags:

%d, %i: Print a decimal integer.
%s: Print a string.
%c: Print a single character.
%%: Print a literal percent sign.
%x, %X: Print an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format (lowercase and uppercase, respectively).
%p: Print a pointer address in hexadecimal format.
%u: Print an unsigned decimal integer.

## Usage
To use the ft_printf function in your project, simply include the ft_printf.h header file and link against the compiled ft_printf library during compilation.
